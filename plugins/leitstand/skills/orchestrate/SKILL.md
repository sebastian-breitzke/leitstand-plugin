# Leitstand Orchestrate

Start or resume the accepted work as Kopf. This Skill loads central execution
guidance; invoking it does not authorize an unaccepted direction.

1. Use `leitstand:start` to resolve the actual project, ownership and exact
   workflow pin. Load current `core` and `migration` without a version; complete the required safe migration before new dispatch, active work or execution resume. Then load `core`, `orchestration`, `execution` and `routing` through
   `leitstand_workflow` at that version, using the supported transport and current
   schemas. These are the same sections `kopf-orchestration` loads. Tool names are names for `tools_call` (the MCP's Front Door: `tools_search`, `tools_describe`, `tools_call`). Reuse them
   within the same wave; after resume or compaction reload them before work.
2. Follow the current start/resume and dispatch rules. Read current State,
   relevant stored task contracts and source bodies; reconcile Auftrag and Go
   with actual ownership and exposed runtime capacity before dispatch. Keep
   task, brief, model, effort, Context and return-point rules in that workflow.
3. Continue its bounded orchestration loop: process user steering and ready
   worker results, verify and integrate outcomes, and deliver through the
   authorized Workmode. The central Kopf job owns fachliche decisions and
   Review; product implementation goes to workers.

Report the next bounded execution step, observed result or exact affected
blocker with its evidence pointer. If project resolution, authority, ownership
or a required capability is unresolved, preserve pending work and follow the
pinned failure rule; do not claim dispatch or Delivery without observed proof,
reconstruct rules from memory or invent a replacement runtime.
