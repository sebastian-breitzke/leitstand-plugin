# Leitstand Brainstorm

Resolve the intended Vorhaben and clarify the requested topic through the
central workflow. This manual entry point loads guidance; the service owns
the intake, Fragerunden, authority and persistence rules.

1. Use `leitstand:start` to load bootstrap and resolve the
   actual project/session assignment before creating anything. Follow its
   ownership rules; a matching title or workspace is only a candidate.
2. Load current `core`/`migration` Guidance first; follow required safe migration before new work in the selected project. Then load the selected project's exact workflow pin and its `core`, `intake`,
   `questions` and `state` sections. For a genuinely new Vorhaben, follow
   bootstrap's current core/intake procedure before creation. Do not silently substitute
   a pin, create a second project for an existing goal or start a parallel
   local process.
3. Follow pinned intake/questions for substantive clarification, source
   retrieval, alternatives, Research and useful mockups or Artefakte. Preserve
   substantial O-Ton and accepted decisions with their provenance on the
   existing central surfaces. Check title-fit through intake's real metadata
   path and authority rules; State wording is not a project rename.
4. Return at the pinned clarification or readiness boundary. Brainstorm adds
   no Build-Go: new Implementation needs its own authorization. Keep already
   authorized independent work running and preserve its ownership. Finalizing
   Slices follows the relevant pinned workflow when requested.

Report an unavailable section, unsupported title mutation or failed readback
as the exact capability gap. Preserve pending input in the conversation and
follow bootstrap/core's failure handling; do not claim central persistence
or invent a replacement workflow.
